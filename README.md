# SPT - Synthetic Patient/Population Toolkit

SPT is a set of tools for viewing and working with data generated by [Syntheaâ„¢](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea).

A demo is available at https://synthetichealth.github.io/spt/#/

## Features
(note features marked with an * are available in the online demo)

### FHIR Patient Viewer*
Drag & drop a FHIR JSON patient Bundle onto the Patient Viewer to get an overview of the patient's Conditions, Medications, Procedures, and other resources in their record. The visualization is based on the [fhir-visualizers library](https://github.com/synthetichealth/fhir-visualizers/).

### SyntheticMass Browser*
[SyntheticMass](https://synthea.mitre.org/) is a repository of 1 million synthetic patients generated by Synthea, representing the state of Massachusetts at 1/7 scale.
SPT includes a minimal browser to access patients via the SyntheticMass API. 
Using this feature locally requires an [API key](https://synthea.mitre.org/api-keys)

### CSV File Browser
Load a set of Synthea CSV files into a database to allow for quick browsing and viewing of individual patients. Tables can be sorted and filtered, and rows are linked back to the patient.


## Quick Start

Requirements:
NodeJS

```sh
git clone https://github.com/synthetichealth/spt
cd spt
npm install
npm start
```

The app will now be running locally at http://localhost:3000


### Configuration

##### Environment Variables

| ENV | Description |
| --- | -------- | 
| SYNTHETICMASS_API_KEY | The API key to use for accessing the SyntheticMass API. Not required except for the SyntheticMass Browser |
| FRONTEND_ONLY | When `true` this disables the backend server and the features that depend on it. This is primarily used to allow for deploying only a static UI, for example to GitHub Pages |
